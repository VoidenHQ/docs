# 📄 XML Block

Sometimes your API speaks **XML** instead of **JSON**.  
The **XML Block** in **Voiden** gives you a dedicated space to write or paste your XML payload — whether you're working with XML-based web services, or legacy systems, whatever.  
Paste in raw **XML** or type it from scratch. The editor handles it cleanly.  
And when your tags get tangled? Hit **Prettify** in the top-right corner to format your XML into properly indented, readable structure.

### ▶️ Try it Out

1. Type `/xml` to add an **XML Block** payload to your Voiden file

2. Paste in (or type) the sample **XML**
3. Hit **Cmd + Enter** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Enter**  (Windows/Linux) to run the request  
**or** click the **green ▶️ Play button** in the toolbar.

> 🎩 **Pro Tip:** Want to comment out a line without overkill?  
> Use **Cmd + /** (Mac) or **Ctrl + /** (Windows/Linux) to comment out an XML line you don't need for that payload.  
> It’ll stay visible but won’t be sent with the request.  
> Unless you click the **Prettify** option in the top right corner of the block. Then all the comments will go bye-bye.

The XML Block handles structured data the old-school way.  
Just clean XML, ready to send.
