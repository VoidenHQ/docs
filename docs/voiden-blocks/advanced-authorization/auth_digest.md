# Auth Digest Block

[Basic Authentication](/docs/voiden-blocks/advanced-authorization/auth_basic.md) is like writing your password on a postcard and mailing it to the server. Sure, it's encoded in Base64, but that's just putting a mustache and glasses on your password - everyone still recognizes it! 😂

**Auth Digest** is like a spy proving they know the secret code by showing they can solve the puzzle, without ever revealing the code itself!

### ▶️ Try it Out

1. In your Voiden file, type `/auth-digest` and press **Enter** to create a **Auth Digest Block**.
